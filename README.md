# Laravel + Livewire + daisyUI Starter Kit

## Introduction

This [Laravel](https://laravel.com) + [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) + [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com) starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Livewire frontend and daisyUI components.

Livewire is a powerful way of building dynamic, reactive, frontend UIs using just [PHP](https://php.net). It's a great fit for teams that primarily use Blade templates and are looking for a simpler alternative to JavaScript-driven SPA frameworks like React and Vue.

daisyUI is a UI component library built on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), which provides ready-made component classes that are fully themable and composable.

This Livewire starter kit utilizes Livewire 3, Laravel [Volt](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/volt), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4 and daisyUI 5.
