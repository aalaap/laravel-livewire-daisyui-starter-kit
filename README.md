# Laravel + Livewire + daisyUI Starter Kit

## Introduction

This [Laravel](https://laravel.com) + [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) + [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com) starter
kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Livewire frontend and daisyUI components.

This Livewire starter kit utilizes Livewire 3, Laravel [Volt](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/volt),
[Folio](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/folio), TypeScript, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) 4 and daisyUI 5.

Livewire is a powerful way of building dynamic, reactive, frontend UIs using just [PHP](https://php.net). It's a great
fit for teams that primarily use Blade templates and are looking for a simpler alternative to JavaScript-driven SPA
frameworks like React and Vue.

Volt is an elegantly crafted functional API for Livewire that supports single-file components, allowing a component's
PHP logic and Blade templates to coexist in the same file.

Folio is a powerful page based router designed to simplify routing in Laravel applications. With Laravel Folio,
generating a route becomes as effortless as creating a Blade template within your application's resources/views/pages
directory.

daisyUI is a UI component library built on top of Tailwind CSS, which provides ready-made component classes that are
fully themable and composable.

## Motivation

Starting with Laravel 12, starter kits are now simply git repos that can be cloned and worked upon, rather than projects
created live by the installer by adding components like Breeze and Jetstream. This makes it easier to offer many
different combinations of technologies, so there's something for everyone.

I've been using daisyUI for a while and I'm building this starter kit with that for my own needs, but I do hope someone
else finds it useful as well.

## Status

This is a very new fork, so at the moment, all we have is pre-installed daisyUI and a redone welcome page. The eventual
goal is to replace as many Flux components with the equivalent daisyUI alternatives as possible and finally removing
Flux entirely.
